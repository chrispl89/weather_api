This program was made while learning Python.

I used requests library, because it's popular library to work with requests from APIs.
json library was used because when I use get method from API, the result will be in string, and loads form json change it into the dictionary.
Another one library was terminaltables. The output will  be in the tables, so much more readable.

My goal when I was doing this program was to learn how to use requests to get the data from the API.
